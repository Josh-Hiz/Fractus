# Fractus++

A 2D fractal visualizer and static renderer using SDL3 and ImGUI. Supports all common (and uncommon) fractal types and multiple resolution sizes (up to 4k!).

Made with C++ to be as efficient as possible, Fractus is effectively a "Fractal Engine," a playground to test and visualize all sorts of fractal types. The main purpose of this project is to build upon this to create a 3D visualizer (Mandelbulbs!) and continue my exploration into the mathematics of Fractals and its incredible applications and properties!

In addition, this project was also a way for me to learn SDL3 and ImGUI, personally, it is more usable than with SFML.

Future projects with SDL3 include physics simulations, 3D visualizers, and even quantitative research and trading!
